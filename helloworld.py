# Python Syntax
# Python Indentation
# Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.

if 5 > 2:
    print("Five is greater than two.")
if 5 < 8:
    print("Five is less than six.")

# You have to use the same number of spaces in the same block of code, otherwise Python will give you an error:
if 5 > 2:
    print("Five is greater than two!")
    print("Five is greater than two!")  

# Python variables

x = 5
y = "Hello Kelvin!"

print(x)
print(y)

# Comments start with a #, and Python will render the rest of the line as a comment:

# This is a comment.
print("Hello, Kipkemboi!")

# A comment does not have to be text that explains the code, it can also be used to prevent Python from executing code:

#print("Hello, World!")
print("Cheers, Mate!")
