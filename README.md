# Python Programming

## What is Python?
Python is a popular programming language created by Guido van Rossum and released in 1991. It is versatile and widely used in various domains, including:

- Web development (server-side)
- Software development
- Mathematics
- System scripting

## What can Python do?
Python is a versatile language with a wide range of applications:

- Create web applications on servers
- Integrate with software for workflow automation
- Connect to database systems and work with files
- Handle big data and perform complex mathematics
- Use for rapid prototyping or production-ready software development

## Why Python?
Python has several advantages:

- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc.)
- Simple and readable syntax, similar to the English language
- Concise code with fewer lines compared to other languages
- Rapid prototyping due to its interpreter system
- Support for procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming

### Good to Know
- The most recent major version is Python 3, which is used in this tutorial. Python 2 is still popular but not actively updated.
- Python can be written in a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Thonny, PyCharm, NetBeans, or Eclipse for managing larger codebases.

## Python Syntax Compared to Other Programming Languages
Python was designed for readability with some unique features:

- Python uses new lines to complete commands instead of semicolons or parentheses.
- Indentation with whitespace defines scope, such as loops, functions, and classes, in contrast to curly brackets used in other languages.
