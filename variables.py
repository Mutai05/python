# Creating Variables
# Python has no command for declaring a variable.
# A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.

name = "Mutai Kelvin"
age = 27

print(name)
print(age)

# Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set.

x = 4
x = "Ess K"
print(x)


# Casting
# If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting.

x = str(3)
y = int(3)
z = float(3)

print(x)
print(y)
print(z)
